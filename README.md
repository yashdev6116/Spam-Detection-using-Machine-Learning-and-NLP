# Spam-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-NLP


Project Overview:-
The "Spam Detection using ML and NLP" project demonstrates a robust approach to identifying and filtering spam messages from non-spam messages. Leveraging machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), this project applies various NLP techniques to preprocess textual data, followed by classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in detecting spam. The application can be used as a foundational model in messaging platforms, email filters, and other communication channels requiring spam detection.

Features:-
Text Preprocessing: Implements comprehensive NLP preprocessing with NLTK, including tokenization, stop words removal, stemming, and lemmatization, which optimizes message classification.
Machine Learning Classifier: Utilizes supervised learning models, evaluated for precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy to ensure high performance.
Adaptable and Modular Codebase: The code is structured to facilitate adjustments for different datasets or classification algorithms.

Technologies Used:-
.Python: Core programming language
.NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing
.Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models
